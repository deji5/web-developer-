                    <p>When a person uses any potentially dangerous and/or mood-altering substance in a frequent and often overindulgent pattern, it is called substance abuse. These substances include prescription and non-prescription drugs, alcohol, and tobacco. Teen substance abuse is an ongoing problem that can have long-term, negative effects on the present and future of the person using the drug, and on his or her family. At some point most teens will come into contact with drugs, alcohol, or both. While some may never try them, others may find themselves trying and eventually abusing drugs as a result of peer pressure, stress, or other reasons. When faced with the decision of using drugs or steering clear of them, knowing how to avoid the temptation and pressure to do so is key. This is easier said than done, however. The teen years are often difficult, even before drugs or alcohol enter the picture. Often this difficulty comes from one's peers as there is stress to behave a certain way, look a certain way and to fit in. Confidence and self-esteem will play a huge role in drug and alcohol prevention.</p><br />
